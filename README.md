#  Introduction

My names are **Ayodeji Oladimeji Daniel**, I'm a 300 Level computer science student of National Open University Of Nigeria.

I started writing codes while i was in 100 level, I've been through many obstacles which add more to my experience on the web development field.

The main reason why i choosed **Frontend development** to be my major is because i love coming up with different designs and not only that,
I always want to give my designs different behaviour irrespective of the design.

## My Major

In my opinion, what defines a good front-end developer is one that has skilled knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS with a vast understanding
of User design thinking, as they’ll be building web interfaces with accessibility in mind. And also a frontend developer should also be excited to learn,
as the world of Front-End Development keeps evolving.

Presently i'm a Frontend developer with the proper skills of **HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY** and a little skills of **PHP**.
With this idea i was able to come up with a mini website for computer science students in National Open University of Nigeria.

Also i have different landing pages i created for dating sites.

Having a working understanding of HTML, CSS and JS is certainly a no-brainer, but it’s only one part of the equation.
I believe a good front-ender connects the dots between user experiences and business goals while closing any gaps
that would prevent holistic user flows. That requires good communication, creative problem solving, empathy and,
perhaps above all, an willingness to listen to and accept criticism.

###  Pathway to Github

- My first experience was learning how to create a repository, I expanded my experience with Branching in Git.

- I acquired the knowledge of cloning a repository by running the `$ git clone` command, followed by the path to the repository.

- I also learnt how to manage Remotes in Git by checking a list of remotes in a repository with the command

`$ git remote -v` or by adding a remote with the `$ git remote add` command.

- Presently, i'm a Frontend Developer and i really love coding.

#### My Dreams

HNGi internship is the greatest opportunity i've been waiting for all my life, because this is the first time i will partake in any program that involves coding.

I've been searching for opportunities to elevate my career and then God sent HNGi to me.

I'm really opportuned to be part of this great program and i am here to commit my full hardwork and also to show my skills properly.

if i get the chance to move to the next phase of this mission, then i'm fully ready to share my innovative ideas with my seniors because i believe in team work.
